# BirdNET-Pi Disk Space Management Script
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This script monitors the disk space used by BirdNET-Pi recordings and
#   automatically purges old files if the used space exceeds a configurable
#   threshold. It is designed to prevent disk full errors and ensure smooth
#   operation of BirdNET-Pi services.
#
# USAGE:
#   - The script is intended to be run automatically (e.g., via cron).
#   - It sources configuration from `/etc/birdnet/birdnet.conf`.
#   - It respects the `FULL_DISK` environment variable to determine whether to
#     purge files or stop services when the disk is full.
#   - Always leaves at least 30 recordings per species.
#   - Deletes files in steps of 5% of MAX_FILES_SPECIES (minimum 5 files per step).
#   - Stops core services if disk remains full after purging.
#
